- Provides custom CSS and JS (platform independent)
- Provides bootstrap 4 CSS styles

## Installation

Install the extension by downloading it in the extension manager or on https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/modals/.
The extension creates various new fields in your tt_content table. Make a backup of your database, if you are not sure about this!

## Basic configuration

You don't need to configure anything to get this extension running.
But clear your caches after installing.

### Using modals with the Bootstrap Package

You can simply include the static TypoScript into your root template to make modals extend the template of the Bootstrap Package.
